> ANSIBLE.BUILTIN.ADD_HOST    (/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible/modules/add_host.py)

        Use variables to create new hosts and groups in inventory for use in
        later plays of the same playbook. Takes variables so you can define
        the new hosts more fully. This module is also supported for Windows
        targets.

ADDED IN: version 0.9 of ansible-core

  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- groups
        The groups to add the hostname to.
        (Aliases: group, groupname)[Default: (null)]
        elements: str
        type: list

= name
        The hostname/ip of the host to add to the inventory, can include a
        colon and a port number.
        (Aliases: host, hostname)
        type: str


ATTRIBUTES:

        action:
          description: Indicates this has a corresponding action plugin so some parts of the
            options can be executed on the controller
          support: full
        async:
          description: Supports being used with the `async' keyword
          support: none
        become:
          description: Is usable alongside become keywords
          support: none
        bypass_host_loop:
          description:
          - Forces a 'global' task that does not execute per host, this bypasses per host
            templating and serial, throttle and other loop considerations
          - Conditionals will work as if `run_once' is being used, variables used will be
            from the first available host
          - This action will not work normally outside of lockstep strategies
          support: full
        bypass_task_loop:
          description: These tasks ignore the `loop' and `with_' keywords
          support: none
        check_mode:
          description: Can run in check_mode and return changed status prediction without
            modifying target
          details: While this makes no changes to target systems the 'in memory' inventory
            will still be altered
          support: partial
        connection:
          description: Uses the target's configured connection information to execute code
            on it
          support: none
        core:
          description: This is a 'core engine' feature and is not implemented like most task
            actions, so it is not overridable in any way via the plugin system.
          details: While parts of this action are implemented in core, other parts are still
            available as normal plugins and can be partially overridden
          support: partial
        delegation:
          description: Can be used in conjunction with delegate_to and related keywords
          support: none
        diff_mode:
          description: Will return details on what has changed (or possibly needs changing
            in check_mode), when in diff mode
          support: none
        ignore_conditional:
          description: The action is not subject to conditional execution so it will ignore
            the `when:' keyword
          support: none
        platform:
          description: Target OS/families that can be operated against
          platforms: all
          support: N/A
        tags:
          description: Allows for the 'tags' keyword to control the selection of this action
            for execution

        until:
          description: Denotes if this action objeys until/retry/poll keywords
          support: full
        

NOTES:
      * The alias `host' of the parameter `name' is only available on
        Ansible 2.4 and newer.
      * Since Ansible 2.4, the `inventory_dir' variable is now set to
        `None' instead of the 'global inventory source', because you
        can now have multiple sources.  An example was added that
        shows how to partially restore the previous behaviour.
      * Though this module does not change the remote host, we do
        provide 'changed' status as it can be useful for those trying
        to track inventory changes.
      * The hosts added will not bypass the `--limit' from the command
        line, so both of those need to be in agreement to make them
        available as play targets. They are still available from
        hostvars and for delegation as a normal part of the inventory.

EXAMPLES:

- name: Add host to group 'just_created' with variable foo=42
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    name: '{{ ip_from_ec2 }}'
    groups: just_created
    foo: 42

- name: Add host to multiple groups
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
    groups:
    - group1
    - group2

- name: Add a host with a non-standard port local to your machines
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    name: '{{ new_ip }}:{{ new_port }}'

- name: Add a host alias that we reach through a tunnel (Ansible 1.9 and older)
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
    ansible_ssh_host: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'
    ansible_ssh_port: '{{ new_port }}'

- name: Add a host alias that we reach through a tunnel (Ansible 2.0 and newer)
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
    ansible_host: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'
    ansible_port: '{{ new_port }}'

- name: Ensure inventory vars are set to the same value as the inventory_hostname has (close to pre Ansible 2.4 behaviour)
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    hostname: charlie
    inventory_dir: '{{ inventory_dir }}'

- name: Add all hosts running this playbook to the done group
  ansible.builtin.add_host:
    name: '{{ item }}'
    groups: done
  loop: "{{ ansible_play_hosts }}"
